Hey, I got my hands on an email where Wargame organizers talk about the game, about this problem in particular:

>Hi Bob,
>
>I finished the flag generator code for the problem. You can download it from [here](http://generator.kepzes.securiteam.kszk.bme.hu/flag_generator). Password is the usual.
>
>Have a nice day!
>Alice

Unfortunately, the file is not downloadable anymore, but I managed to intercept Bob's traffic when he downloaded the script. You can find it attached below. Can you get me the flag?
